                    <p class="leader-name">Adam Stoker</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Adam is our fearless leader and CEO at Relic. Plus, he has an incredible origin story. After excelling in BYU’s prestigious advertising program, Adam took a job at an advertising agency where he was able to quickly learn the ropes and work on some large accounts, including Ken Garff Automotive Group and Lagoon. Adam became known as the Kobe Bryant of the office; he was first to the office and last to leave, and he developed a real love for the work he was doing. </p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Realizing that the only way he could be happy was to go into debt, Adam began applying to graduate schools after a year and a half in the advertising industry. As he was wrapping up his application, he saw an opening for a small advertising agency based out of St. George, and that was when his life changed.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Adam joined Sorenson Advertising when there were just four employees, and though he didn’t know it, he was shaping Relic’s future from his first day. He began to change the culture and demonstrated how a small agency can be more successful than a large one. Adam personally brought in TDS, a Wisconsin-based telecom company that was easily Sorenson’s largest client. When he was ready for the next step is his career, Adam, along with Jordan Barker (Chief Digital Officer), Colby Remund (Chief Creative Officer) and Nick Christensen (silent partner) bought Sorenson Advertising and rebranded to Relic, the industry leading agency you know and love.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Under Adam’s leadership, Relic has seen incredible growth. Relic has transformed from a small agency with a few clients to a thought-leading industry expert. However, Adam will be the first to tell you that money isn’t what matters. Adam works every day with the ideal to change the advertising industry. Innovation is the motor that keeps businesses running, and Adam’s passion is indisputably a game changer.</p>

                    <img class="leader-pic" src="../../images/Jordan.png">
                    <p class="leader-name">Jordan Barker</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">The year is 2008. The Dark Knight just became the first superhero film epic; Usain Bolt shattered the 100-meter dash world record; Beyoncé and Jay-Z just had a wedding of historic proportions; Jordan Barker began transforming the digital marketing world. Now, we’re not saying that Jordan had anything to do with these wonderful, world altering events, we just wanted to point out the correlation.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">However, as Relic’s Chief Digital Officer, Jordan is responsible for similar world changing events. Graduating from Utah Valley University’s business program, Jordan’s expertise lies in analytics. Being able to quantify and track the success of our clients is of utmost importance, and Jordan’s proficiency in the digital space has taken Relic’s marketing to a whole new level. Jordan has all the analytical savvy of Wall Street, with none of the felonies.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">His early career experience has driven results for brands such as Walgreens, Pfizer, Bayer, The University of Phoenix, Pluralsight and Microsoft. This, combined with his expertise at Relic, has made Jordan an industry leader in the digital marketing sphere. Around Relic, he is known as our Admiral Ackbar – a leader who does most of his work behind the scenes with the analytical skill and digital marketing expertise to give his team a proper battle plan. Plus, he’s always willing to warn us if there’s a trap.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">When Jordan isn’t busy dissecting data, he enjoys reading, playing and watching sports, spending time with his family and long walks on the beach. Admittedly, having Jordan to lend his digital expertise also makes our jobs at Relic a walk on the beach.</p>

                    <p class="leader-name">Colby Remund</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">What Colby lacks in hair, he makes up in creative prowess. While most of his creative juices stem from finding new ways to trick his children into eating vegetables, his considerable experience in the advertising field also helps quite a bit. Colby graduated from Brigham Young University’s prestigious advertising program, where he was an award winning art director, and has been a professional in the industry since 2007. He joined the Relic family in 2011 after a brief, unsuccessful stint on the PGA Tour, or maybe he was just watching the PGA Tour. Who can remember?</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Colby is known for his detail oriented behavior, which is probably why he has such a strong creative eye. As Chief Creative Officer for Relic, Colby lends his bright mind to the brilliant ideas from our creative team. His meticulous nature ensures that all his work is done perfectly and efficiently, like a well-oiled, creatively enhanced machine. This very nature is what makes Colby the perfect man to lead our creative team and ensure that we deliver the absolute best creative possible.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Despite his widely successful professional portfolio, Colby knows that his greatest creations are his children. He and his wife, Crystal, are parents to four wonderful children, and they’re positive at least one of them will turn out okay.</p>

                    <p class="leader-name">Jessica Merrill</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Jessica joined Relic in 2012 after graduating cum laude from Dixie State University with her BS in Communications. She comes from a long line of media professionals – her family has been in the radio business for more than 70 years. For reference, public radio has only been around for about 100 years. Also for reference, Happy by Pharrell Williams has been playing on the radio for four years, though it may feel like 400.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Directly out of school, Jessica worked in ​the nonprofit sector, managing community outreach, planning events and convincing the media to run free advertising for her organizations, including the Utah Chapter of the Alzheimer Association. Jessica has always loved the media world; as she was advancing in her career, she switched gears to be more involved in the advertising industry. As Media Director, Jessica leads all media planning, buying and budgeting. She specializes in all traditional media, direct mail and media strategy. Her experience in the nonprofit sector also makes her an expert at receiving supplementary media spend at no cost, a skill that does not go unnoticed by our clients as she delivers further value to each of them. Additionally, Jessica is in a devoted, long-term relationship with spreadsheets, proving that love truly has no bounds.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Keeping her love for the community alive, Jessica also currently sits on the Board of Directors for the Utah Parent Center, a nonprofit organization in Salt Lake City that helps provide resources for families and children of disabilities. Jessica loves traveling and has been everywhere, giving her a world view that has made her even better at what she does. She values her relationships and has developed close friendships with many of our current clients. Jessica and her enthusiastic daughter enjoy skiing, baseball games, going to Universal Studios and watching movies. Besides traveling, she also loves reading as much as possible, attending concerts and sometimes even playing the occasional round of golf. She believes books and shoes solve most problems, and we would be inclined to agree.</p>

                    <p class="leader-name">Hannah Lunt</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">With all the writing aptitude of Mark Twain and none of the subtle racism, Hannah has proven to be invaluable to Relic’s team. She has been working for years to refine her craft and become the best writer in the business, which all comes back to her hard work and dedication. Hannah got started at a young age, when she broke child labor laws to read water meters at 13-years-old to make some extra cash.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Luckily, we at Relic were the beneficiaries of Hannah’s negligence for the law. Her vigor has carried over into her professional career, and it shows. Hannah graduated magna cum laude from Brigham Young University’s esteemed public relations program. Before coming to Relic, she worked at Underwriter Laboratories in Chicago where she was able to work with large publications such as ABC News, the LA Times, Readers Digest and the Chicago Tribune. This experience helped her to learn the inner-workings of the world of public relations and excel as Relic’s PR and Content Manager.</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">While Hannah may seem like a sweet person, those who are closest to her know that she is ultra-driven, which both pushes her to be great at her job and makes her an awesome person to have in our company softball games. When she’s not working (which isn’t very often), Hannah and her husband love to travel, be outdoors and give back to their community. She is currently a youth leader at a local church and volunteers at the Boys and Girls Club. If they made frequent diner cards for service, Hannah would be well on her way to a free meal.</p>
